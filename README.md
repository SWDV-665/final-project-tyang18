# Family App

## Home
Contains a list of my family members that can be added or removed. 

Since this is an app for my personal use only, the way that members are added are unique to my knowledge. 

### Use-case:
To add a member, click the "Add member" buttom at the bottom of the card list. 

Input the member's name, Date of Birth, Image location, and Page link:
Tou Yang -- 7/29/1993 -- ../../assets/imgs/1.png -- Tou

This will then add Tou Yang into the list. 

Members can be editted or removed as well. 

Finally, click the member picture on the list to go to their personal page. 

### Personal Pages
Each member will have a pre-made page already and more will be added on. 

Each page has 3 cards with the first card holding personal information about the member.

Second card holding their family tree.

Last card holding a gallery of their personal images grabbed from their personal imgs folder. 


## Events
Utilizes the Ionic Native Calendar that creates an events onto the mobile devices native calendar. 

This is a great way for my family members to keep in touch with each other. 


## Gallery
A sizeable gallery of all our images. 

Static page and unclickable image thumbnails. 



# Unfinished Parts and Future Improvements

### Clickable Images
Unfortunately, I did not get much time to implement a clickable function for each of the image thumbnails so that they can expand in size. This would have been a great addition to the gallery and personal gallery. 

### Member Cards
Member cards could have buttons positioned better such as 2 stacked buttons to the right of the card. 

## More family member pages
As the app continues to be developed, I would have liked to add more member pages and add a video section to the tabs.
